        <h2>Connection between Born a Crime and my County</h2>
         <p>In the two chapters we learn about the injustices and inequalities happening. <br>
            There are laws which are classified based on peopleâ€™s race and social class. <br>
            The racial discriminations and ethnic classes where some residents are restricted<br>
             are the same as in my county where people from poor backgrounds are not allowed <br>
             to go to the suburbs and dont have the same rights and privileges as those from <br>
             the dynasties. </p>

            <p>From Born a crime we see a highlight of resilience and strength between individuals <br>
                who navigate challenging circumstances. People in Siaya county are always facing <br>
                various challenges but they strive to do better and defend themselves from those <br>
                who feel they are untouchable. People are seen fighting for their rights in the county.<br>

              <p>Trevor talks about poverty which relates to my county. People from different social <br>
                classes live in different areas. The high class live in a secured private place while <br>
                the poor live in the slums where there is a lot of violence happening on a daily basis. <br>
                The poor don't have access to security and good services unlike those from the suburbs.</p>

             <p>In Born a crime we see violence between the Zulus and Xhosas. This happens in Siaya county <br>
                as there are tribal disputes between luos and luhyas. They fight trying to prove who is<br>
                 better than who and who deserves to be at the top. As someone who lives between the border <br>
                 of Siaya county and Busia county alot of conflicts are witnessed as the two tribes claim <br>
                 they are both superior.</p>
