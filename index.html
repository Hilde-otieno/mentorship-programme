            <p>The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, </p>
            <p>but in rising every time we fall. -Nelson Mandela</p>
            <p>The way to get started is to quit talking and begin doing. </p>
            <p>-Walt Disney Your time is limited, so don't waste it living 
            <p>someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma which is </p>
            <p>living with the results of other people's thinking. -Steve Jobs</p>
            <p>The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their </p>
            <p>dreams. -Eleanor Roosevelt</p>
            <p>If you look at what you have in life, you'll always have more. </p>
            <p>If you look at what you don't have in life, you'll never have </p>
            <p>enough. -Oprah Winfrey</p>
            <p>If you set your goals ridiculously high and it's a failure, you will</p>
            <p>fail above everyone else's success. -James Cameron</p>
            <p>You may say I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one. I hope someday</p>
            <p>you'll join us. And the world will live as one. -John Lennon</p>
